# NOTEtaker
Using express js I made a note taking application. To start off I had to npm install and install path and express as well as npm init -y for a default package.json. Starting off the process I had to require each of the modules in a const variable then I made a const Port variable and a const variable I called app to store express then I used  app.use(express.json()); which basically is just a method built in express to recognize the incoming Request Object as a JSON object then using another method built into express used app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); to recognize the incoming objects as strings or arrays. The very first thing I did after the initial steps was make the html routes that looked something like this app.get("/notes", function (req, res) {res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "public/notes.html"));}); and all this does is call the route using get then uses a function with the argument res that gets the information being posted from the api routes as response thats what the "/notes" is for the get the api rout information while the public/notes.html is actually sending the information from the api route to the the html.
