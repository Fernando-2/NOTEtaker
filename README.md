# NOTEtaker
Using express js I made a note taking application. To start off I had to npm install and install path and express as well as npm init -y for a default package.json. Starting off the process I had to require each of the modules in a const variable then I made a const Port variable and a const variable I called app to store express then I used  app.use(express.json()); which basically is just a method built in express to recognize the incoming Request Object as a JSON object then using another method built into express used app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); to recognize the incoming objects as strings or arrays.
